# Black-WhitePlane
# Program Finished Date: 2016/6/23
 I made this little program to review my WINDOWS API knowlage, not for making a good game.<br />
 I just pushed many codes together, so this program looks mess.<br />
 I updated this mess program, because i want to make more friends with game programmers.<br />
 
# Some tips of this mess game:
<pre>
Controls:
  ↑: forward 
  ↓: back 
  ←: left 
  →: right 
  s: shoot 
  F1: save state 
    MY NOTICE: 1. It can't be used at menu or gameover interface.
               2. It can cover last save data.
  F2: load state 
    MY NOTICE: 1. It can't be used at menu or gameover interface.
               2. Everytime you open the program, the F2 is not available until you press F1. 
                  If you press F2 directly, the game will become a "Ink Wash Painting".
  F3: infinite life
    MY PRATTLE: Me: The boss's AI is a little crazy. So i set this function. You like it, right?
                You: This facking terrible mess game has a boss and the boss has AI? are you kidding me? 
                Me: ah...   
Reward:
  The Red P: update your fire level. Make you wider, longer and stronger.  Max level: 5 
  The Blue S: increase Speed level. Make you faster!  Max level: Mabe 3? or 4? I forget it. hahaha...
    MY PRATTLE: ah.. Women will like this!
